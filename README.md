# Planner-
As part of the Learn IT Girl I am developping a Java desktop application. The application should be a planner of day by day tasks and important events. The application will offer a calendar like interface, where users can view tasks for each day and also create tasks.
The planner offers the following functionalities:
- monthly view of the calendar and weekly view
- prioritization of tasks
- creating one time or recurring events
- 15 minutes, 10 minutes, “starting now” reminders for tasks.
The planner will help you organize your time and your family.
