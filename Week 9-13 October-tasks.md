1. Update the README.md of the project with the finalised description on GitHub. We can do this during the second call of the week when we will be live practicing Git commands. 

2. Create a folder called Week 9-13 October and inside this folder create a text file containing the list of tasks. Commit this text file to GitHub. 

3. Create a Hello World Java program - a program that has it's main purpose to display the message "Hello World from a Learn IT Girl mentee!". 

4. Create a Java program that has 2 functions: the main() function and a boolean function called isEven that receives an integer number as a parameter and returns true or false. The returned result should be true if the number is even, otherwise false. A number is even if it's divisible by 2. In the main() function call the boolean function for several numbers such as 16, 11, 101, 22, etc. Print the result of each call for these numbers.

5. Create a Java program that has 2 functions: the main() function and an integer function called sumN that receives an integer n number as a parameter and returns the sum of numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. In the main() function call the function for several numbers of your choice and print the results for each call. 

6. Create a Java program that has 4 functions: the main() function and a function that computes the sum of 2 numbers received as parameters, a function that computes the difference of 2 numbers received as parameters, a function that computes the average of 2 numbers received as parameters. In the main() function call each of these function for several pairs of numbers of your choice. Each time print the results. Examples: 10 and 20, 65 and 78, etc. 

7. Create a Java program. Initialise an array (int []). Print all the numbers from the array on a single line. The numbers should be separated by spaces. Sort the array using Arrays.sort and then print once again all the numbers from the array on a single line. 

8. Create a Java program. Initialise an array (int []). Sort the array using Arrays.sort and search a value in the array using Arrays.binarySearch. Each time print the result of the search. First call the binarySearch function for a value that exists in the array and the second time for a value that does not exist in the array. 

9. Create a Java program. Inside the main function create an ArrayList and fill it in with Integers of your choice. Print the maximum, minimum and the sorted array. Use functions from Collections (Collections.max, Collections.min, Collections.sort). 

10. Create a Java program. The goal of this task is to create two functions getMin and getMax which receive an array as parameter and that will compute the min value and the max value from an array. You will no longer use existent methods such as Collections.min/max, you will create your own implementation. Inside the main() function initialise an array and print the result of the getMin and getMax functions for the given array. 

11. Create a Java program. Instantiate a String object with the contents: "I like roses. Yesterday I bought some roses. I have many roses in my garden". Replace all the occurences of "roses" with "flowers". Use methods available for the String class: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html. 

12. Create a Java program. Instantiate two String objects. Concatenate the two strings. Print the result and the length of the resulting String.
