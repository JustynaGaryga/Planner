1. Think about a scenario about a person that is using your application. Imagine that you are an user that opens your application. What does the person see on the first screen of the application ? What are the options for him - what he can do in this screen ? What are the other screens/ functionalities? Try to imagine a detailed scenario of usage of your application. 

2. Based on this scenario, try to think about the classes of the application. The classes are generally the entities and the main elements, information that we would like to be saved (like Users, Tasks, Events, etc). 

3. Based on the scenarion, create mockups of the screens of the application using an application for creating mockups (sketches of the screens).

Applications for creating mockups (you can try several of them and then choose your favourite):

- Balsamiq: https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/
- Mockup designer: http://fatiherikli.github.io/mockup-designer/#document/96a6f532-2c23-72e4-2718-8f7751389c62
- quickMockup: https://jdittrich.github.io/quickMockup/
- mockFlow: https://mockflow.com/

4. Create a screen with:
- 2 buttons on the right corner: "Add a new User" and "Add a new Task"
- on the left of the screen display the list of tasks and of Users
- create ArrayList for Users and for Tasks
